### Introduction

This post is about wiring the [AMS AS72Sx 6 channel broad band spectrometer](../../sensors/sensors-ams/) to an Arduino board.

#### The I2C communication bus

The spectrometer communicates with the board (Arduino) using the [I2C protocol (communication bus)](https://howtomechatronics.com/tutorials/arduino/how-i2c-communication-works-and-how-to-use-it-with-arduino/). I2C is very popular because it can carry signals from multiple sensors (devices). This is possible because each sensor is given a unique serial address (id). The sensor data is sent in a serial address format using only two (2) wires: Serial Clock (or SCL) and Serial Data (or SDA). The SCL line is the clock signal which synchronize the data transfer between the devices on the I2C bus and itâ€™s generated by the master device. The other line is the SDA line which carries the data.

#### Preparing the Arduino IDE

Your Arduino board must have the SCL and SDA ports required for the I2C communication bus. If you are using one of [Arduino's standard boards](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/boards) they should be included with the latest version of <span class='app'>[Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software)</span>.

If instead you are using a board from a partner, you probably need to configure Arduino IDE for that particular board. As an example, you can look at the manuals for how to [configure Arduino for the Adafruit's Metro Express board](https://learn.adafruit.com/experimenters-guide-for-metro/configure-arduino-for-the-metro-express).

#### Arduino library

Code packages that connects an Arduino board to different devices, including break out boards, sensors, displays, communication and storage devices, are available from different libraries. The <span class='app'>Arduino</span> app has a library manager that you reach from the menu:

<span class='menu'>Sketch -> Include Library -> Manage Libraries</span>

The basics for handling libraries is explained on Ardiuons official page [Installing Additional Arduino Libraries](www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries).

### Adafruit or sparkfun

Breakout boards with the AMD AS72Sx sensor(s) are offered both by [Adafruit](../../components/components-adafruit/) and [Sparkfun](../../components/components-sparkfun-spectrometer/). Sparkfun is easier to work with if you use their [Qwiic](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic) connect system for I2C devices. You can then use the [Qwiic Cable - Breadboard Jumper (4-pin)](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14425) for connecting the spectrometer to the board. If you use the Adafruit spectrometer you have to solder the breakout board.

### Wiring

The wiring is the same regardless if you use the Adafruit or Sparkfun breakout boards. The Adafruit manual is [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-as7262-6-channel-visible-light-sensor?view=all).
