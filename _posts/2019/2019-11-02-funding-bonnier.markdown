### Bonnier ventures

[Bonnier ventures](https://www.bonnierventures.com)

"Invest in digital scale-ups from exceptional founders."

"Launched as Bonnier Growth Media in 2013, Bonnier Ventures is the venture arm of the Bonnier Group. As a financially driven corporate venture investor, we make minority investments in fast growing digital technology companies across multiple growth stages. With a stronghold in the Nordics and ambition to scale globally."

Since its start (2013 I think) the venture arm of Bonniers has shifted from a wider, philanthropic, perspective to a more narrow growth and economic perspective.

Could be interesting to try, but doubtful.
