### Zennström philanthropies

[Zennström philanthropies](https://www.zennstrom.org)  has two strategic programmes designed to support [Human Rights](https://www.zennstrom.org/human-rights) and the [Environment](https://www.raceforthebaltic.com).

Even if the Environment focus is the Baltic Sea, it is oriented towards cities it seems.

### Norrsken

More relevant, check the following two supported projects:

#### WEFARM

[Wefarm](https://wefarm.co) is a free peer-to-peer service that enables farmers to share information via SMS, without the internet and without having to leave their farm.

#### IGNITIA

[Ignitia](https://www.ignitia.se) has developed a high-resolution tropical weather forecast model raising accuracy from 39% to 84%, which means that small scale farmers in the tropical regions can plan their farming a lot better. Better planning improves their farming yields and puts food on the table.
