### Sparkfun

These Sparkfun components are built on the [AMS AS726X Spectral Sensing Engine](../../sensors/sensors-ams)

There are 3 Sparkfun versions of the AS726X (but it seems that sparkfun has messed up the links somehow):

- [AS7261 UV bands](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15490)
- [AS7262 Visible bands](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15491)
- [AS7263 Red to NIR bands](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15492)

Plus one [breakout board that combines all three to an 18 channel spectrometer (SparkFun Triad Spectroscopy Sensor - AS7265x)](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15050)

I bought these components from [digi-key Sweden](https://www.digikey.se), they arrived within 48 hours at my doorstep (now shipment cost). I was rather impressed by that.
