### BMC

Business Model Canvas (BMC)

[Youtube introduction on BMC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoAOzMTLP5s).

[Business Model Canvas Explained with Examples (Google, Skype, Gilette)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CakUeC1sCSs), the examples make it easier to understand how to simplify.

[Osterwalder explaining the Business Model Canvas (examples from Nestle coffee, tea and baby milk machines)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzkdJiax6Tw&t=1537s)

[Pokemon Go - Business Model Canvas Case Study](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CN0cBZwNtWs). interesting because it deals with maps in mobile phones.

Having seen these videos, I think that BMC is a great idea. But the businesses examples makes me realise why I am not in those un-interesting sectors of society.

### Lean startup
