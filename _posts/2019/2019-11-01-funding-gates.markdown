### [Gates Foundation](https://www.gatesfoundation.org)

#### Funding process

Reading about [strategy development](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/How-We-Work), it seems that the process for identifying projects is internal and when it comes to identifying organisations that can be involved the focus is on tax exempt US organisation.

#### Funding FAQ

Reading the [Grantseeker FAQ](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/How-We-Work/General-Information/Grantseeker-FAQ), it seems near impossible to get funded unless you are on Gates foundation internal short list. And most of the organisations on that list are US non-profit NGOs.

#### Funded projects

[Digital Green](https://www.digitalgreen.org/farmstack/), including: FarmStack - Delivering location and time-specific advice to farmers to boost agricultural productivity and nutrition security. ($10,558,707).

The Digtial Green project is similar to the [WEFARM](https://wefarm.co) project [supported by norrsken](../funding-zennstroem/).
