This is a list of miniature spectrometers offered.

Scientific article

[Portable Spectroscopy](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0003702818809719). Includes a review of SCiO (not impressining)

# Real miniature spectrometers

## In the pipeline

### Crowdfunding etc

[Kris Winer] aims to make this happen with the Compact, $25 Spectrometer entry for The 2018 Hackaday Prize. The project takes advantage of smaller and smarter spectral sensors to fit the essential bits onto a PCB that’s less than an inch square. If the sensors do the job as expected then that’s a big part of the functionality of a reflectance spectrometer contained in a PCB less than an inch square and under $25; definitely a feat we’re happy to see.

(Designing and building an inexpensive spectrometer just got easier with AMS' new 3-chip AS7265X smart spectral sensor; once this is working, building a modern tricorder should be a piece of cake!)[https://hackaday.io/project/143014-compact-25-spectrometer]

REALLY EXCITING, at 50 USD and 20 nm spectral resolution.

### SCiO

700-1100 nm, 12 bands. And you can not get any spectra, only via online connection.

## Lightmachnery.com

[Lightmachnery.com](https://lightmachinery.com) does not seem to offer consumer market spectrometers.

## oceanoptics.com

[Oceanoptics.com](https://oceanoptics.com ) always comes out in all google searches. I do not find any consumer products.

## Stellarnet.us

[Stellarnet.us](https://stellarnet.us) also always come out. They have a series called:

### BLUE-Wave Miniature Spectrometer
https://www.stellarnet.us/spectrometers/blue-wave-miniature-spectrometers/
But it is not really a spectrometer that you carry around and attach to your phone.

### Green-Wave Miniature Spectrometer
https://www.stellarnet.us/spectrometers/green-wave-low-cost-spectrometers/
But it is not really a spectrometer that you carry around and attach to your phone.

### i-Phos USB IR, UV Light Spectrometer
