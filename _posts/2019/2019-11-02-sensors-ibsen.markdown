### Ibsen

[Ibsen photonics](https://ibsen.com) produces small spectrometers that integrate a grating, a sensor and electronics. The sensor seems to usually be Hamamatsu. This is cool, but is in essence what I have in my homebuilt spectrometer.

I can not find any price for the Ibsen products.

The two most interesting spectrometers at a first glance seems to be:

[PEBBLE Ultra Compact OEM Spectrometers](https://ibsen.com/products/oem-spectrometers/pebble-spectrometers/), and the [product sheet](https://ibsen.com/wp-content/uploads/Ibsen-Product-Sheets-PEBBLE-VIS.pdf). 380-850nm

[Compact and cost-efficient OEM spectrometer modules for the VIS-NIR range](https://ibsen.com/products/oem-spectrometers/freedom-spectrometers/freedom-vis-nir/), and the [product sheet](https://ibsen.com/wp-content/uploads/Ibsen-Product-Sheets-FREEDOM-VIS-NIR.pdf). 475-1100 nm
