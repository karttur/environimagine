### AMS sensors

AMS is an Austrian company.

The Arduino breakout boards from both [Sparkfun](../../components/components-sparkfun-spectrometer/) and [adafruit](../../components/components-adafruit/) are built on the AMS series of 6-channel broad band micro-sensors:

- [AS7261](https://ams.com/AS7261)
- [AS7262](https://ams.com/AS7262)
- [AS7263](https://ams.com/AS7263)

All of these pages contain a very instructive video.

The [AS726x Demo Kit](https://ams.com/as726xdemokit) is a Windows PC-hosted evaluation environment, designed to provide the user an quick-start approach to spectral sensing.
