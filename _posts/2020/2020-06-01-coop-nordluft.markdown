### Nordluft

[Norduft](http://www.nordluftautomation.com) was founded in Stockholm 2018 by a group of dedicated engineers with the mission to use drones together with automation technology in order to enable efficient and sustainable material handling in forestry and agriculture.

Our products enable efficient drone logistics for heavy payloads at a fraction of the time, cost and energy of any other method used today.

Nordluft is associated with [SmartAgriHubs](https://smartagrihubs.eu/portal)
